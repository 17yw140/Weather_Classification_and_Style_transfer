# Weather_Classification_and_Style_transfer
Codes are heavily borrowed from CycleGAN, CycleGAN-tensorflow, ForkGAN and DCGAN. The network architecture design is modified from DCGAN. The generative network is adopted from neural-style with Instance Normalization.

We initially built a basic CycleGAN using PyTorch, then developed the final model using TensorFlow.
